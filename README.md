# FreeVoice - Server

  FreeVoice is an open-source project that provides decentralized voice chat and text communication, focusing on privacy, openness, and independence from centralized platforms. 🚀

---

  This repository is the home of the FreeVoice server — the heart ❤️ of this project. \
  It is the home for user accounts and is responsible for managing groups and communication between clients. \
  
  Once the FreeVoice server is ready for use, the development of a FreeVoice client will also begin. \
  This will allow users to communicate via any FreeVoice server in the form of a desktop application. \
  The separation between the FreeVoice server and client will enable others to provide alternative clients, allowing for even freer, more secure, and more independent communication.
